MyApp - Utility Tools (ASP.NET Core MVC)
=======================================

Overview
--------
MyApp is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that provides three utility
features through a simple web interface. The project follows a clean
separation of concerns by placing all core logic in a dedicated service
class and exposing that functionality via MVC controllers and views.

This project also includes NUnit unit tests written using the
AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern and is containerized with Docker.

Features
--------
1) Count vowels in a string
2) Check if a year is a leap year
3) Detect if a number is a palindrome

Architecture
------------
Core logic is implemented in a service layer:

- IUtilityService
- UtilityService

The MVC layer (controllers/views) only handles user input and displays
results, while the service contains the full implementation of each
feature.

Key project areas:
- Services/
- Controllers/
- Models/
- Views/
- MyApp.Tests/

Requirements
------------
For local development:
- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 (recommended)

For container usage:
- Docker Desktop

Running the App Locally (without Docker)
----------------------------------------
From the repository root:

1) Restore dependencies:
   dotnet restore

2) Run:
   dotnet run

Then open the URL printed in the console.

Running Unit Tests
------------------
Tests are written with NUnit and follow AAA style.

From the repository root:

   dotnet test

You can also run tests using Visual Studio Test Explorer.

Code Coverage
-------------
The test suite is designed to meet or exceed the assignment requirement
of at least 90% test coverage, with strong coverage of UtilityService.

If using coverlet:

   dotnet add MyApp.Tests package coverlet.collector
   dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

Docker
------
A Dockerfile is included in the repository root.

Build the image:
   docker build -t myapp-utilities .

Run the container:
IMPORTANT: The app is configured to listen on port 8080 inside the
container.

   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name myapp-utilities-container myapp-utilities

Open:
   http://localhost:8080

View container logs:
   docker logs myapp-utilities-container

Stop and remove the container:
   docker stop myapp-utilities-container
   docker rm myapp-utilities-container

Deployment (Course Environment)
-------------------------------
This project may be deployed to Azure depending on course setup.

If the Azure Web App is configured for container hosting and the app
listens on port 8080, the following application setting may be required:

   WEBSITES_PORT = 8080

Live site (if required by instructor):
   https://wp1-17786859-fa25.azurewebsites.net

Deliverables Included
---------------------
- Full source code in GitHub repository
- Dockerfile and .dockerignore
- NUnit test project using AAA pattern
- TESTING.md explaining test philosophy and coverage
- README (this file) with setup and Docker instructions
- Short demo video showcasing:
  - Utility features
  - Tests passing
  - Docker build/run

Author / Course Notes
---------------------
This application was built to meet course requirements emphasizing:
- Service-based architecture
- MVC UI for each utility function
- Unit testing with NUnit
- >= 90% test coverage
- Dockerized execution
